## 1. What is wolfXcore?

wolfXcore is a self-hosted game server management panel. It provides:

- A **web-based control panel** to start, stop, restart, and configure your servers
- **Real-time console access** directly from your browser — no SSH needed
- **File manager** to upload, edit, and delete server files
- **Automated backups** to protect your data
- **Database management** for games that need MySQL/SQLite databases
- **Multi-user support** — grant sub-users access to specific servers with granular permissions
- **Multiple game support** — Minecraft, Rust, ARK, CS2, Valheim, FiveM, and 50+ more

---

## 2. Getting Started as a User

### Step 1 — Create an Account
Go to `panel.xwolf.space` and click **Create an Account**. Fill in your email, username, and password.

### Step 2 — Choose a Plan
Browse the available plans on your dashboard. Each plan defines how much RAM, CPU, and disk space your server gets.

### Step 3 — Contact Admin to Provision
After picking your plan, contact the administrator (see [Getting Support](#9-getting-support)) with:
- Your **username/email** on the panel
- The **plan** you want
- What **type of server** you need (Minecraft, bot, web app, etc.)

The admin will create your server and it will appear on your dashboard within minutes.

### Step 4 — Launch Your Server
Click your server on the dashboard, then press the **Start** button. Your server will boot in seconds.

---

## 3. Managing Your Server

Once your server is provisioned, you have full control from the panel.

### Console
The **Console** tab shows your server's live output. You can type commands directly into the console input — just like an SSH terminal, but in your browser.

### File Manager
The **Files** tab lets you:
- Browse all server files and folders
- Upload files from your computer
- Edit config files directly in the browser (`.properties`, `.yml`, `.json`, etc.)
- Create, rename, move, and delete files

### Backups
The **Backups** tab lets you create snapshots of your server. A backup saves all your files so you can restore to a previous state if something breaks.

> **Tip:** Create a backup before installing mods, updating the game, or making major config changes.

### Databases
The **Databases** tab allows you to create MySQL databases for your server. Games like Minecraft plugins and web apps often need a database to store player data.

### Schedules
The **Schedules** tab lets you automate tasks — for example, automatically restart your server at 3 AM every day, or run a backup every 6 hours.

### Sub-users
The **Users** tab lets you invite other users to help manage your server. You control exactly what they can see and do — for example, you can give a friend console access but prevent them from deleting files.

### Settings
The **Settings** tab shows your server's resource limits, SFTP credentials (for connecting via FileZilla or WinSCP), and reinstall/reset options.

## 5. Plans & Pricing

Plans are managed by the administrator. Each plan includes:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|

## 6. Admin Panel Guide

The admin panel is accessible at `/admin`. Only users marked as **root admin** can access it.

### Overview
Shows total server count, user count, node count, and active plans at a glance.

### Servers
Manage all servers across all users. You can:
- Create servers on behalf of users
- Change resource limits (RAM, CPU, disk)
- View and access any server's console
- Suspend or delete servers

### Users
Manage user accounts. You can:
- Create new users
- Promote users to admin
- Reset passwords
- View all servers owned by a user

### Nodes
Nodes are the physical or virtual machines that actually run the servers. Each node runs the **Wings** daemon which communicates with the panel.

To add a node:
1. Go to **Admin → Nodes → Create New**
2. Fill in the node's public hostname/IP
3. Follow the Wings installation steps shown on the configuration tab
4. Allocations (IPs + ports) must be added before servers can be created on the node

### Plans & Pricing
Create hosting plans that define RAM, CPU, disk, and monthly price. These appear on the user dashboard when a user has no servers.

### Nests & Eggs
**Nests** are categories (e.g., "Minecraft", "Rust"). **Eggs** are the specific server templates within a nest. Each egg defines:
- The Docker image to use
- Default startup command
- Environment variables
- Install script

## 7. Nodes & Infrastructure

### How it works
```
User Browser
     │
     ▼
wolfXcore Panel (panel.xwolf.space)
     │  ← API calls (HTTPS)
     ▼
Wings Daemon (node.xwolf.space:8080)
     │  ← Docker
     ▼
Game Server Containers
```

### Wings (the node daemon)
Wings is a Go-based daemon that runs on each node. It:
- Receives commands from the panel (start, stop, install, backup)
- Manages Docker containers for each server
- Streams console output back to the panel
- Handles file operations, backups, and databases

### Requirements per node
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+
- Docker installed
- Minimum 2 GB RAM (more = more servers)
- Public IP or hostname reachable from the panel

## 8. FAQ

**Q: My server is stuck on "Installing"**
A: The egg's install script ran into an issue. Check the server's Install Log in the admin panel, or delete and recreate the server with a different egg/version.

**Q: I can't connect to my game server**
A: Make sure:
1. The server is showing as **Running** in the console
2. You are using the correct IP and port from the **Settings** tab
3. The port is opened on the node's firewall

**Q: My server ran out of memory and crashed**
A: The RAM limit was hit. Contact admin to upgrade your plan, or reduce the amount of plugins/mods on your server.

**Q: Can I upload a world/save file?**
A: Yes — use the **File Manager** to upload a `.zip` and then extract it, or connect via SFTP using the credentials in your server's **Settings** tab.

**Q: How do I get SFTP access?**
A: Go to your server → **Settings** → copy the SFTP host and port. Use FileZilla or WinSCP. Your username and password are your wolfXcore panel credentials.

**Q: How do I restart automatically?**
A: Go to **Schedules** and create a new schedule. Set it to run a `restart` action on a cron schedule (e.g., `0 3 * * *` for 3 AM daily).

## 10. Super Admin System

The Super Admin system is an owner-level security layer built into wolfXcore. It sits above regular admin access and allows the panel owner to manage, promote, or revoke admin privileges — even from users who already have admin access.

### How It Works

- The Super Admin panel has **no sidebar link** — it is only accessible by navigating directly to the URL
- Authentication page: `panel.xwolf.space/admin/wxn-super/auth`
- Only the correct secret key unlocks the panel
- Once authenticated, the session stays active until you log out or close the browser
- Closing the browser or logging out ends the Super Admin session

### What You Can Do in the Super Admin Panel

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| View all admins | See every user with admin access |
| Revoke admin | Remove admin access from any user |
| Promote users | Grant admin access to any regular user |
| View all users | Browse and manage every account on the panel |

> **Your own account is always protected.** You cannot accidentally demote yourself from within the Super Admin panel.

---

### Setup During Deployment

The Super Admin key is stored in your server's `.env` file and is **never stored in the database or exposed in the panel UI**.

**Step 1 — Generate a strong random key:**

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Copy the output (e.g. `a3f9b2c1d4e5...`).

**Step 2 — Add it to your VPS `.env`:**

```bash
echo "SUPER_ADMIN_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE" >> /var/www/wolfxcore/.env
```

Replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE` with the key you generated.

**Step 3 — Clear the config cache:**

```bash
cd /var/www/wolfxcore
php artisan config:clear
php artisan config:cache
```

> Store your key somewhere secure (e.g. a password manager). Anyone who knows this key can access the Super Admin panel.

---

### Changing the Key

To change your Super Admin key at any time:

1. Edit `/var/www/wolfxcore/.env` and update `SUPER_ADMIN_KEY=`
2. Run `php artisan config:clear && php artisan config:cache`
3. All existing Super Admin sessions are immediately invalidated

---

### Security Notes

- The key is compared using timing-safe comparison to prevent brute-force attacks
- The Super Admin URL prefix (`/admin/wxn-super/`) is not listed anywhere publicly
- Regular admins cannot see the Super Admin panel contents — only the locked sidebar link
- There is no "forgot key" — if you lose it, update the `.env` and run config:cache
